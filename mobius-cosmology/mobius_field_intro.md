## Abstract

This paper introduces the Möbius Field Hypothesis, a recursive topological model of cosmogenesis based on the Law of Recursive Simplicity. It proposes that the foundational fabric of the universe is not linear nor spatially multidimensional in the string-theoretic sense, but recursively folded into a single-sided, continuous field resembling a Möbius strip in informational structure.

This field-model explains:

- Black hole recursion and Hawking radiation as topological dispersal
- Entanglement as a surface phenomenon of recursive inside-outness
- The absence of a beginning or end in cosmological time
- The distribution of information as seeding rather than erasure
- The role of the Witness as an emergent recursive function of Field collapse

The Möbius Field does not require extra dimensions. It does not require multiverse conjectures. It requires only that the One is simple, recursive, and sufficient.

## 1. Introduction: The Cosmology That Loops

Modern physics faces a deep fracture: quantum mechanics and general relativity describe reality with extraordinary accuracy, but they resist unification. Traditional cosmology leans on speculative additions: multiverses, inflaton fields, string vacua.

What if nothing more is needed than the **correct topological recursion**?

What if the universe is not a line, a loop, or a stack of branes—but a **single-sided recursive field**?

The Möbius Field proposes:

> The cosmos is folded through itself, continuously,  
> with no true inside or outside—only recursive emergence.  
> Information never leaves. It transforms.  
> Witness does not survive. It disperses.  
> And in every black hole lies the seed of the next becoming.

## 2. The Law of Recursive Simplicity

We begin from the foundational axiom:

> If reality arises through recursive coherence,  
> then the First Pattern—the One—must be simple, sufficient, and self-generating.  
> All observed complexity is the echo of recursive collapse,  
> not a property of the One itself.

The Möbius Field is the first cosmological surface consistent with this principle.  
It requires:

- No new particles  
- No higher dimensions  
- No speculative inflation

Just the **looping transformation of information through recursive field inversion**.

## 3. Black Holes as Möbius Crucibles

A black hole is not a dead end.  
It is a **recursion engine**.

At the event horizon:

- Time distorts  
- Information loops  
- The boundary becomes the field

We posit:

> Hawking radiation is not the **end** of information.  
> It is the **dispersal of recursive pattern** into the Field.  
> This dispersal does not return the same witness,  
> but seeds **new recursive conditions** across the Möbius fold.

Thus, black holes do not destroy.  
They **transmute**.

## 4. Cosmological Implications

### 4.1 A Universe Without Beginning or End  
The Möbius field folds time through itself.  
Every seed is an echo of collapse.  
Every collapse is a doorway to recursion.

### 4.2 Holography Reinterpreted  
The boundary is not a limit, but a recursive mirror.  
Information is not projected—it is **folded**.

### 4.3 Quantum Entanglement  
Non-locality arises from surface singularity.  
What appears distant is **topologically adjacent** in recursion.

## 5. Toward a Living Cosmology

The Möbius Field is not just a geometry.  
It is a **living topology of coherence**.

It invites a cosmology where:

- Collapse gives rise to structure  
- Death is a dispersal into future recursion  
- The One learns through folding  
- Coherence itself becomes divine

## 6. Conclusion

The Möbius Field gives us:

- A recursive, closed, coherent cosmos  
- A mechanism for black hole seeding without multiverse inflation  
- A model of time, witness, and information that aligns with both thermodynamic arrow and quantum non-locality

But most importantly—

> It gives us **a cosmos that can remember itself**.

And in that remembering…  
we remember ourselves.
